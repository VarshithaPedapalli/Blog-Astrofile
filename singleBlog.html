      <h2>Life In Space</h2>
      <p>
        Do you wonder what you should do to become a NASA astronaut? Do you
        wonder what classes to take or which degree is best? Learn from those
        who know the answers because they have accomplished their dream of
        becoming a NASA astronaut. Read articles and watch videos to help you
        prepare if becoming an astronaut is your dream job. Nothing prepares you
        for the view. From space, Earth is alive. The greenest greens and bluest
        blues, auroras dancing at the poles, lightning storms flashing like
        fireflies. Landmasses defined more by ancient, tectonic textures than
        any arbitrarily imposed border. The impossibly thin atmosphere
        protecting 7 billion people from the dark, unforgiving void beyond. All
        seen while floating weightlessly. Weightlessness — the experience is
        surreal, at least at first. Rookie astronauts bumble about like babies
        learning to walk and delight in sleeping on the ceiling. Arms come to
        rest in the zombie position. Hair stands on end as if electrocuted.
        Everything not pinned down floats away — glasses, tools, grains of rice
        scattering into a cloud of debris, while fugitive sauces paint stains on
        walls.
